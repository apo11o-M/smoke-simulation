# Smoke Simulation


## What is this?
This is a program that mimicks how smoke flows in a 2D plane using C++ and the SFML Library. 

Currently I'm still experimenting with the concept so it still has some limited features. In the futue I will be adding more stuff such as different colors, upward force that lifts the direction of the smoke, and perhaps some basic physics simulation when the smoke hit an obstacle.
